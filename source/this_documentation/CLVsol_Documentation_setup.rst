		* `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

		* `HTML theming support <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.8/theming.html>`_: Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via themes. A theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files. Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist for customizing the theme’s look and feel.

		* `The build configuration file <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.html>`_: The configuration directory must contain a file named conf.py. This file (containing Python code) is called the “build configuration file” and contains all configuration needed to customize Sphinx input and output behavior.

Project creation
----------------

	::

		# cd /opt
		# sudo mkdir clvsol
		# sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /opt/clvsol/
		# cd /opt/clvsol
		# mkdir docs

		cd /opt/clvsol/docs
		mkdir clvsol

	::

		cd /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol
		git init

		git add README.rst
		git commit -m 'Initial commit'

	::

		cd /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol
		sphinx-quickstart

	::

		Welcome to the Sphinx 3.2.1 quickstart utility.

		Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
		accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

		Selected root path: .

		You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
		Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
		"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
		> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y

		The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
		> Project name: CLVsol Documentation
		> Author name(s): Carlos Eduardo Vercelino - CLVsol
		> Project release []: 1.0.0

		If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
		you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
		translate text that it generates into that language.

		For a list of supported codes, see
		https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
		> Project language [en]: pt_BR

		Creating file /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol/source/conf.py.
		Creating file /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol/source/index.rst.
		Creating file /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol/Makefile.
		Creating file /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol/make.bat.

		Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

		You should now populate your master file /opt/clvsol/docs/clvsol/source/index.rst and create other documentation
		source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
		   make builder
		where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
